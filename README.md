# Student Management App

In this project, i tried to make a simple student management system with useState hook. Where u can manage data of all students, u can take attendance of students,u can see a student is present or absent. 

in this project, I focused on implement SCSS & BEM methodology with react. Understand state & one way data flow more deeply. Handled Edge cases carefully.

# Main focus on:

1)Implementation of SCSS & BEM methodology in react app.

2)Handling Edge Cases

3)Build a Proper CRUD operation

4)Understand react state & one-way data flow from the core & deeply.

5)Managing states without any support like redux or context API.

6)React hooks (useState,useEffect)

# Challenges I faced in this project:

This is my experimental project with React. I faced many difficulties, first of all, i faced difficulties with managing state, then I understand why redux or context API needs. managing one-way data flowing was the first challenge. then I struggled with handling Edge Cases. In this app, there is a lot of edge cases like, check if a student is present then u can't add him/her in absent, if u will not give valid input u can't add your data etc.
